## 📖 Project Origin

Before I started playing guitar, I dreamed of playing the drums. Unfortunately, this instrument didn't meet with approval from other household members. However, I managed to convince my parents to buy me a bass guitar instead, which worked out well for me.

Many years have passed, I still don't have drums and probably never will. But the desire to learn at least basic drumming skills remained. What if I could practice finger-drumming on my phone? That's how the idea for this app was born.

I know there are many similar applications, but I wanted something simple that could run on any phone (and computer) without installation. The tool is ready, now it's time to practice!
